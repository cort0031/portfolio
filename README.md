# Crimson Studio Portfolio
### By Martin Cortes
Portfolio for the final Web Development II Assignment
---
## Brief Description
This portfolio was created using a Mockup created in the User Experience class. It was first created by making a proper structure including sections over the home page than can portray what I've learned in my Web Development classes.
The main page has a logo, my studio name, a brief description of my self, my work and some skills developed recently. You can also find a form to get in contact if you press a button to reveal it.
The Main navigation is divided by topics: Blogging, because I like to teach and write, about topics I know very well; Portfolio, showing in detail different aspects of my work and knowledge; and gallery, because I love art and I wanted to show my skills as an illustrator.
Most of the sections of the page were created using bootstrap, with different types of code such as "collapse" to hide forms, "grids" to make the gallery, "cards" to build topics, "navigation" to create the main nav bar, rows and columns to make things responsive, and finally some anchor tags to create some flow through the page (including skip links at the start of every page).
## Challenges
Some of the challenges I found making this page were not creating cards initially, I also couldn't find a way to hide my form with the button untill I found the collapse option. And I wasn't using the buttons and anchors tag correctly, so I had to create a styling for the anchor tag and replace all the buttons with that new styled anchor tag.
## What I learned
Even though we've made lots of exercises during class, creating a whole project requires of preparation, and a proper workflow. It helps a lot to make comments in your coding so you can keep track of things. 
Some things may not make sense while you're coding, and you're right, because the validator will eventually show you if you made any mistakes, however, validating the code will help you understand the logic under the structure of programming and it will help you a lot the more you practice it.

To my teachers at Algonquin College, because in 8 months I started with zero knowledge about coding, and I wouldn't been able to do it with ut their lessons, pacience and knowledge. Rob Kingsbury and Abhay Sharma, thank you so much!!
